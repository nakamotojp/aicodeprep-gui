## [1.0.3] - 2025-06-22

### ✨ New Features

- **Native OS Context Menu Installers:**
  - Added a `File` menu option to easily install a right-click context menu for your operating system's file manager.
  - **Windows:** "Install Right-Click Menu" dialog with options for custom menu text and enabling/disabling the classic (full) context menu for Windows 11.
  - **macOS:** "Install Finder Quick Action" to add an "Open with aicodeprep-gui" action to Finder.
  - **Linux:** "Install File Manager Action" for automated installation of a Nautilus (GNOME/Cinnamon) script, with manual instructions for other file managers.
- **Automatic Update Checker:**
  - The application now non-intrusively checks for new versions on PyPI upon startup.
  - If an update is available, a dialog will appear offering a one-click upgrade option.
- **"About" Dialog:**
  - Added a new "Help" -> "About" menu that displays the current version, update status, and how long the app has been installed.

### 🔄 Changed

- **Improved Documentation:**
  - Complete overhaul of `README.md` with a more professional tone, clearer installation instructions (recommending `pipx`), and better feature descriptions.
- **Windows Integration:**
  - The application now sets a Windows AppUserModelID for a proper, consistent taskbar icon.

### 🛠️ Technical Improvements

- **New Dependencies:** Added `requests` and `packaging` to support the new update checker.
- **New Modules:** Added `windows_registry.py`, `macos_installer.py`, `linux_installer.py`, and `update_checker.py` to modularize the new installer and update-checking logic.
- **Anonymous Telemetry:** A basic, one-way anonymous ping is sent on startup to help estimate the number of active users. This sends no personal data or code. See `PRIVACY.md` for details.
